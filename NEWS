Changes in ufodecode 0.2.2
==========================

This is a bugfix release:

- Fix 10 bit decoding that shows wrong output when ADCs are almost saturated
- Fix 12 bit decoding that capped some output channels at 10 bits
- `ipedec` returns error code different from 0 when an error occurred
- `ipedec` reports the frame rate again with the `--frame-rate` switch set


Changes in ufodecode 0.2.1
==========================

This is a bugfix release:

- Fix 12 bit decoding according to CMOSIS specs
- Fix command line input of `ipedec`
- Truncate so-Version to major.minor


Changes in ufodecode 0.2.0
==========================

Name change
-----------
In accordance to the rest of the software, the type names changed from
`ufo_decoder_t` to `UfoDecoder`. Moreover there is no typedef for pointers to
`UfoDecoder` structures.


API breakage
------------
To simplify debugging, all status data is passed from the decoded frame to the
caller of `ufo_decoder_decode_frame()` and `ufo_decoder_get_next_frame()` by
means of the new `UfoDecoderMeta` structure as defined in `ufodecode.h`.


Minor changes
-------------
- The decoder supports version 4 and 5 of the UFO camera frame format.
- `ipedec` now has a proper command line interface.
- `ipedec` prints the frame meta data when using the verbose command line switch
  (`-v` or `--verbose`).
