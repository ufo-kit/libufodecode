Changes in ufodecode 0.2.0
==========================

Name change
-----------
In accordance to the rest of the software, the type names changed from
`ufo_decoder_t` to `UfoDecoder`. Moreover there is no typedef for pointers to
`UfoDecoder` structures.


API breakage
------------
To simplify debugging, all status data is passed from the decoded frame to the
caller of `ufo_decoder_decode_frame()` and `ufo_decoder_get_next_frame()` by
means of the new `UfoDecoderMeta` structure as defined in `ufodecode.h`.


Minor changes
-------------
- The decoder supports version 4 and 5 of the UFO camera frame format.
- `ipedec` now has a proper command line interface.
- `ipedec` prints the frame meta data when using the verbose command line switch
  (`-v` or `--verbose`).
